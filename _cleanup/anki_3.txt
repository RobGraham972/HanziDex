What three components define a function \(f: A \to B\)?	A domain \(A\), a codomain \(B\), and a rule that assigns a unique element in \(B\) to each element in \(A\).
For a function \(f: A \to B\), what is the term for the set of all values that are actually taken by \(f\), i.e., \(\{y \in B : y = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in A\}\)?	The range of \(f\).
Why is the curve defined by the equation \(y^2 = x\) not the graph of a function?	Because a single input value, for example \(x=1\), is associated with two different output values, \(y=1\) and \(y=-1\).
What is the intuitive, informal definition of a continuous real function?	A function is 'continuous' if we can draw its complete graph without removing the pen from the paper.
State the rigorous, sequential definition of continuity for a function \(f: A \to B\) at a point \(a \in A\).	The function \(f\) is continuous at \(a\) if for every sequence \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) in \(A\) that converges to \(a\), the sequence \(f(a_n)\) converges to \(f(a)\).
Consider the function \(f(x) = \begin{cases} -1 & \text{if } x \le 0 \\ 1 & \text{if } x > 0 \end{cases}\). Explain why it is discontinuous at \(x=0\) using a specific sequence.	The sequence \((1/n)\) converges to \(0\), but the sequence \((f(1/n)) = (1, 1, 1, ...)\) converges to \(1\), which is not equal to \(f(0) = -1\).
In the context of function limits, what is the intuitive meaning of the statement 'the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is \(L\)'?	If you choose values of \(x\) which are close but not equal to \(a\), then \(f(x)\) will be close to the value \(L\).
The statement \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L\) means that for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists a _____ such that for all \(x \in A\) with \(|x-a| < _____\) we have \(|f(x) - L| < \epsilon\).	\(\delta_{\epsilon}\)
State the Product Rule for limits of functions. Assume \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) and \(\lim_{x \to a} g(x)\) exist.	\(\lim_{x \to a} (f(x)g(x)) = (\lim_{x \to a} f(x)) \cdot (\lim_{x \to a} g(x))\).
State the Quotient Rule for limits of functions. Assume \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) and \(\lim_{x \to a} g(x)\) exist.	\(\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x \to a} f(x)}{\lim_{x \to a} g(x)}\), provided \(\lim_{x \to a} g(x) \ne 0\).
What is the \((\epsilon - \delta)\)-definition of continuity for a function \(f: A \to B\) at a point \(a \in A\)?	For every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists a \(\delta_{\epsilon} > 0\) such that for all \(x \in A\) with \(|x - a| < \delta_{\epsilon}\) we have \(|f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon\).
In an \((\epsilon - \delta)\) proof of continuity for \(f(x) = 3x - 7\) at \(x = 4\), how can \(\delta_{\epsilon}\) be chosen in terms of \(\epsilon\)?	We can choose \(\delta_{\epsilon} = \epsilon/3\), because \(|(3x-7) - 5| = |3x-12| = 3|x-4|\), so requiring \(3|x-4| < \epsilon\) is equivalent to \(|x-4| < \epsilon/3\).
In an \((\epsilon - \delta)\) proof of continuity for \(f(x) = 1/x\) at \(x_0 > 0\), we have \(|f(x) - f(x_0)| = \frac{|x - x_0|}{x x_0}\). If we assume \(\delta < x_0/2\), what lower bound does this place on \(x\)?	The assumption \(|x - x_0| < x_0/2\) implies that \(x > x_0/2\).
What does the notation \(x \to a^+\) signify when taking the limit of a function?	It means that \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the right, i.e., through values greater than \(a\).
What does it mean for the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) tends to \(\infty\) to be \(L\)?	For every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a number \(A_{\epsilon}\) such that for all \(x > A_{\epsilon}\), we have \(|f(x) - L| < \epsilon\).
For the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2}\), what is \(\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x)\)?	\(\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = \infty\).
For the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2}\), what is \(\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x)\)?	\(\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = -\infty\).
